# Circle-detection-OpenCv
A Circle Detection Algorithm Based on Circle Hough Transform &amp; OpenCv

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this repository is to show a basic algorithm to detect circles in an image of large scale for educational & research purpose. The code provided is not yet optimized and some minor improvements are required. The code utilized OpenCV & Numpy libraries. The source code is based on circle Hough Transform (CHT) is a feature extraction technique for detecting circles. Radius and other parameters can be tunned for different scenarios.

> Step_1: Set path for the image from which cirles need to be detected

> Step_2: Set path on which cropped images to be saved & with certain name tag on it. (like orange_1, orange_2, ...)

> View: A window will open providing the overall detected cirlces from the image
